# blackmagicjack
blackmagicjack is a game based off of blackjack (or 21) and UNO.
This game has abilities on certain cards, and aces are only counted as 1 instead of both 1 and 11.
The goal of the game is to be the closest to 33, but you have 3 lives!
Don't worry, you're able to have more than 3 lives!

## Why did you make this?
This was my RST project in my ICS2O class! We were given a final project of trying to create a game in Python, and blackjack was the game that I decided to try creating, but with cards that are able to change the way the game goes!
